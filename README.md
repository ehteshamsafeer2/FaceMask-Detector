The Facemask Detector web application is a tool that can help businesses, schools, and organizations enforce facemask wearing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The app uses machine learning algorithms to analyze images and determine whether or not the person in the image is wearing a facemask. The application can be used to scan photos taken by security cameras, cell phones, or other devices to detect whether or not people are following facemask protocols.

This application can play an essential role in helping organizations to promote public health and reduce the spread of COVID-19. By using the Facemask Detector web application, organizations can monitor compliance with facemask policies, identify areas where people are not wearing masks, and take action to enforce policies and protect the health of employees and customers.

The Facemask Detector web application is a powerful and flexible tool that can be customized to meet the needs of different organizations. It can be integrated with existing security systems, deployed on-premises or in the cloud, and accessed through a web interface or an API. Whether used by schools, businesses, or other organizations, the Facemask Detector web application is a valuable tool in the fight against COVID-19.
